How to conduct Unit Tests for Quiz App

Note: Must have Junit installed to run tests on a text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse (Mac terminal not recommended)


```bash 
git clone https://github.com/taamir-khan/QuizApplication
  ```

```bash
cd QuizApp/src/unit_tests && javac Test.java
```

Alternatively, go to your IDE, open this application, and then press run under QuizApp/src/unit_tests/Test.java as there is an issue compiling using the terminal.
